# Data model

One local SQLite database (`Application Support/HHT/travel.sqlite`, WAL mode). Schema versions are
tracked in `PRAGMA user_version`; migrations live in `Packages/HHTCore/Sources/HHTCore/Database/Schema.swift`
and are append-only.

**Conventions**
- `*_ts`: UTC Unix seconds (REAL). `tz`: IANA time zone of the device when recorded (e.g. `America/New_York`).
  "Local" values (person-day, hour of day) are computed with the record's own `tz`, so travel across zones stays correct.
- Coordinates: WGS84 decimal degrees. Distances: metres, great-circle (haversine, R = 6 371 008.8 m).
- IDs: lowercase UUID strings for derived/user records (stable across exports), integer for raw points.
- `route_polyline`: Google encoded polyline, precision 1e-5, simplified with Douglas–Peucker (8 m).
- Nothing the user corrects is hard-deleted: `deleted = 1` soft-deletes; `audit_log` keeps old → new values.

## Three layers

| Layer | Tables | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Raw observations | `raw_location_points`, `motion_activities` | collector (append-only, never edited) |
| 2. Inferred events | `visits`, `trips`, `trip_segments` with `user_status = 'auto'` | inference engine (may be rebuilt) |
| 3. Canonical, user-corrected | same rows with `user_status ∈ {confirmed, edited, manual}` | edits; locked against rebuilds |

## Tables

### raw_location_points
| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| id | integer PK |
| ts | fix time (UTC s) |
| lat, lon | position |
| h_accuracy / v_accuracy | 1σ-ish accuracy radius (m) reported by iOS |
| altitude, speed (m/s), speed_accuracy, course (°) | as reported; NULL if invalid |
| source | `gps`, `significant_change`, `region_exit`, `visit_arrival`, `visit_departure`, `stationary_marker`, `imported_gpx` |
| collector_mode | `moving` / `stationary` — lets inference know a silence was deliberate |
| tz | device time zone |
| inserted_at | when written |

`stationary_marker` = the collector's last fix, re-stamped at the moment it stops GPS. `visit_*` = iOS CLVisit events.

### motion_activities
CoreMotion activity episodes: `ts` (start), `activity` (`stationary|walking|running|cycling|automotive|unknown`),
`confidence` (0 low, 1 medium, 2 high). An activity lasts until the next row.

### places
`id, name, lat, lon, radius_m, address, city, region, country, category, code, favorite, notes, source, merged_into, deleted, created_at, updated_at`

- `category`: `home, work_school, restaurant, cafe, grocery, shopping, recreation, entertainment, airport, rail_station, transit_station, hotel, friend_family, medical, other`.
- `code`: IATA/station code. `source`: `inferred | manual | imported_csv`.
- `merged_into`: set when the user merges duplicates (the row stays as a tombstone; all visits point to the target).
- `deleted`: soft delete (schema v2) when the user deletes a place that isn't real; its visits are soft-deleted too
  and the trips around them joined, as for "this wasn't a stop".
- First/last visit, visit count and dwell are derived (see `places.csv` export or `placeStats()`).

### visits  (activities / stays)
| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| id | UUID |
| place_id | → places |
| arrival_ts, departure_ts | departure NULL = still there |
| lat, lon | observed centroid of the stay |
| purpose | explicit activity purpose (else implied by place category; see `v_trips.purpose_final`) |
| auto_confidence | 0–1, from fix count and duration |
| source | `inferred | manual | imported_csv` |
| user_status | `auto | confirmed | edited | manual` |
| deleted | soft delete ("this wasn't a stop") |
| tz, point_count, notes, created_at, updated_at | |

### trips
| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| id | UUID |
| origin_visit_id, destination_visit_id | → visits (NULL for manual/imported history) |
| origin_place_id, destination_place_id | only used when there are no visits (imported history) |
| departure_ts, arrival_ts | |
| distance_m | along the recorded path (straight line across data gaps) |
| mode_auto, mode_confidence | classifier output (see inference.md) |
| mode_user | user correction; **final mode = COALESCE(mode_user, mode_auto, 'unknown')** |
| purpose | explicit trip purpose override |
| route_polyline | simplified route |
| has_gap | a >15 min hole in GPS during the trip |
| auto_confidence, source, user_status, deleted, tz, notes, created_at, updated_at | |

### trip_segments
Mode segments inside a trip: `id, trip_id, seq, start_ts, end_ts, mode_auto, mode_confidence, mode_user, distance_m, route_polyline`.
The trip's `mode_auto` is the main mode of its segments by the HHTS hierarchy (air > rail > transit > car > bike > walk).

### flights
`id, trip_id (→ trips, if detected/linked), journey_id, date (local YYYY-MM-DD), origin_code, destination_code, origin_lat/lon, destination_lat/lon, departure_ts, arrival_ts, airline, flight_number, aircraft_type, seat, cabin, distance_m, booking_reference, notes, source, created_at, updated_at`.
Airplane trips create a flight row automatically (codes blank until the airport place has a code).

### journeys, journey_members
Reserved for multi-leg intercity journeys (access trip → flight → egress). Schema present; UI not built yet.

### life_phases
`id, name, kind (semester|job|residence|vacation|research_trip|other), start_date, end_date (inclusive, NULL = ongoing), notes`.

### airports
Reference data from OurAirports (public domain), downloaded on request: `iata, icao, name, municipality, country, lat, lon, type`.

### audit_log
`id, ts, entity_type (visit|trip|trip_segment|place|flight), entity_id, action, field, old_value, new_value`.
Actions include `set_mode, set_purpose, set_place, set_times, merge, split, delete, confirm, create, relink, infer_departure`.
This is also a labelled training set: every `set_mode` row is a ground-truth mode for a trip.

### app_meta
Key/value: `last_inference_at`.

## Views (for SQL users)
- `v_trips`: non-deleted trips + `mode_final`, `purpose_final` (explicit → visit purpose → place-category default),
  `duration_s`, `origin_place_final`, `destination_place_final`.
- `v_visits`: non-deleted visits + place name/category + `duration_s`.

## Export files
`trips.csv` is the canonical HHTS-style table: `person_day_id` (local date of departure), `trip_seq` (order within
the person-day), OD place ids/names/categories/coordinates, UTC and local times, `travel_time_min`, `distance_m`,
`mode`, `mode_group`, `mode_auto`, `mode_confidence`, `mode_user`, `n_segments`, `segment_modes` (`walk|subway|walk`),
`purpose`, `has_gap`, provenance. Every other CSV joins on the same IDs. `*_ts` columns are accompanied by `*_utc` ISO strings.
